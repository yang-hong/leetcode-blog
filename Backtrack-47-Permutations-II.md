## 🧩 Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/description/

## 💭 My thinking process
For each level of the tree (horizontal), we can always start from the begining, which means just call the recursion without passing any starting_index. We need to track duplicates under each path, because if we won't track, the recursion will always start at index 0, which means it will have so many duplicates like[1,1,1]. Need to take care of the duplication logic

## 💡 Things I have challenges with
1. duplication logic: if (i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and not used[i - 1]) or used[i]:
                continue

## 🧠 Code
```
class Solution:
    def permuteUnique(self, nums):
        nums.sort()  # 排序
        result = []
        self.backtracking(nums, [], [False] * len(nums), result)
        return result

    def backtracking(self, nums, path, used, result):
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            result.append(path[:])
            return
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if (i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and not used[i - 1]) or used[i]:
                continue
            used[i] = True
            path.append(nums[i])
            self.backtracking(nums, path, used, result)
            path.pop()
            used[i] = False

```

## 📈 Complexity
| Stage                | Why                                                                    | Cost                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Build recursion tree | Each level picks from remaining numbers → n × (n−1) × ... × 1 branches | O(n!)                |
| Copy permutation     | Each full `path` has n elements → copying costs O(n)                   | O(n × n!) total      |
| Recursion stack      | Max depth = n                                                          | O(n) auxiliary space |
